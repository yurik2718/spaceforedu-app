  #      request is in an editable status (draft, awaiting_reply).
  #   2. A progress counter (X/3) toward the required documents — only useful
  #      while the student can still act on it.
  #   3. A read-only listing of what was uploaded — for download/audit.
  #
  # Earlier the card always rendered all 6 placeholders regardless of state,
  # which made non-editable statuses look like a to-do list the student
  # couldn't satisfy. These tests pin down the intended state-aware rendering.
